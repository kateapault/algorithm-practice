# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
# ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one 
# hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
